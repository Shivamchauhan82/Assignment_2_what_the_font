        <p>-{Verse 1}- <br>
            I Found A Love For Me  <br>
            Oh, Darling, Just Dive Right In And Follow My Lead <br>
            Well, I Found A Girl, Beautiful And Sweet <br>
            Oh, I Never Knew You Were The Someone Waiting For Me <br>

        </p>

        <p>-{Chorus}- <br>
            Baby, I’m Dancing In The Dark With You Between My Arms <br>
            Barefoot On The Grass, Listening To Our Favourite Song <br>
            When You Said You Looked A Mess, I Whispered Underneath My Breath <br>
            But You Heard It, Darling, You Look Perfect Tonight <br>
        </p>

        <p>-{Verse 2}- <br>
            Well I Found A Woman, Stronger Than Anyone I Know <br>
            She Shares My Dreams, I Hope That Someday I’ll Share Her Home <br>
            I Found A Love, To Carry More Than Just My Secrets <br>
            To Carry Love, To Carry Children Of Our Own <br>
        </p>

        <p>-{Pre-Chorus}- <br>
            We Are Still Kids, But We’re So In Love <br>
            Fighting Against All Odds <br>
            I Know We’ll Be Alright This Time <br>
            Darling, Just Hold My Hand <br>
            Be My Girl, I’ll Be Your Man <br>
            I See My Future In Your Eyes <br>
        </p>

        <p>-{Chorus 2}- <br>
            Baby, I’m Dancing In The Dark, With You Between My Arms <br>
            Barefoot On The Grass, Listening To Our Favourite Song <br>
            When I Saw You In That Dress, Looking So Beautiful <br>
            I Don’t Deserve This, Darling, You Look Perfect Tonight <br>
        </p>

        <p>-{Chorus 3}- <br>
            Baby, I’m Dancing In The Dark, With You Between My Arms <br>
            Barefoot On The Grass, Listening To Our Favourite Song <br>
            I Have Faith In What I See <br>
            Now I Know I Have Met An Angel In Person <br>
            And She Looks Perfect <br></p> 

        <p>-{Outro}- <br>
            I Don’t Deserve This <br>
            You Look Perfect Tonight <br></p>
